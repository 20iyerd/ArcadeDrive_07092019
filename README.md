## Instructions:
If you've never used GitHub before, click that **green button** near the top called _Clone or download_.

Once the extraction is finished, you can open the folder in VSCode by opening a new window of VSCode.
Click _File_ then _Open_ and navigate to the downloaded folder.

The code we modified is in the **src/main/java/frc/robot/drivetrain** folder.
